Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software engineering is the process of applying engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain software systems. It basically involves design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.

Software engineering is important in the technology industry since it allows the development and maintenance of software systems which are used in day to day activities.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
1. Development of programming languages - these include languages such as python, C, C++ which are essential in software development
2. Advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3. Rise of the agile methodologies in the 2000s

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
1. Requirements - Gathering user and system needs 
2. Design - This is the creation of a high level design of syustem architecture and user interface
3. Implementation - This is writing of code and building the software 
4. Testing - This is checking whether the implemented software matches the user requirements
5. Deployment - This is releasing software to the customers and users
6. Maintenance - Provision of ongoing support and updates to the developed software

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
Waterfall methodology involves systematic approach in the development. From Requirements, to design, implementation till maintenance. It is appropriate where all user requirements are known and the full product is required. Agile methodology on the other hand ivolves implementation in iterations, where once one iteration is done, the next portion of it is implemented. This is appropriate where not all user requirements are known or defined.

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
1. Software developer - Writes codes and implements software solutions
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures quality of products developed by designing and executing test plans
3. Project Manager - Oversees planning, execution and deployment of software projects

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
IDEs provides tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g. Visual Studio Code
VCS tracks changes to source codes and allows collaborating in the work done e.g. Git

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
Changing requirements - user requirements may change during the development cycle which may lead to developers having to start their implementation
Tight deadlines - Pressure for delivery may compromise the quality of the system developed
Technical debt - Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions

**Strategies to overcome**
Effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
Unit testing - Testing of individual components and modules of a software
Integration testing - Interactions between different components or subsystems]
System - Testing the entire system as a whole
Acceptance testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it matches user needs.

**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**
**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Prompt engineering crafting questions or statements to obtain the best responses from the AI models.
It is important as it helps get a clear and specific answer.

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
Vague prompt - How is a call connected?
Improved prompt - What is the process of making a call between mobile subscribers within the same network?
